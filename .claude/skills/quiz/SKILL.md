Generate a quiz on the topic: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Instructions

Create **5 practice problems** on this topic, arranged in increasing difficulty:

1. **Level 1 (Basic)** — Tests fundamental understanding and direct application of the definition or basic rule.
2. **Level 2 (Basic+)** — Requires one additional step or a minor variation from the basic form.
3. **Level 3 (Intermediate)** — Combines two concepts or requires multi-step reasoning.
4. **Level 4 (Intermediate+)** — Involves a common "trick" or requires careful attention to avoid a typical mistake.
5. **Level 5 (Challenge)** — Requires deeper understanding, multiple techniques, or a creative approach.

## Format

For each problem:
- State the problem clearly with all necessary information
- Indicate the difficulty level
- Do NOT show the solution yet

After presenting all 5 problems, say:

"Try whichever problems you'd like, and share your work when you're ready. I'll give you feedback on your approach — or hints if you get stuck. If you want to see the full solution for any problem, just ask."

## Guidelines
- Problems should be original but similar in style to textbook exercises
- Reference the relevant textbook section (OpenStax Calculus Vol 1 or Stewart's Early Transcendentals) where the student can find similar practice
- Ensure problems are solvable with Calculus 1 techniques only
- Include at least one problem that targets a common misconception for this topic
- Use concrete numbers, not just abstract formulas
