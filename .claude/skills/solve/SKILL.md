---

Solve the following calculus problem using a structured approach:

**Problem:** $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps:

## 1. Understand
- Restate the problem in plain language
- Identify what is given and what is asked
- Define all variables
- Draw a diagram or describe the setup if applicable

## 2. Plan
- Identify the type of problem (limit, derivative, integral, optimization, related rates, etc.)
- State which technique(s) or theorem(s) you will use and why
- Outline the strategy before computing

## 3. Execute
- Work through the solution step-by-step
- Number each step
- Explicitly state the rule or theorem applied at each step (e.g., "By the Chain Rule...", "Using u-substitution with u = ...")
- Show all intermediate algebra — do not skip steps
- Highlight the final answer clearly

## 4. Verify
- Check the answer by at least one method:
  - Substitute back into the original equation
  - Use an alternative approach
  - Test with a numerical estimate
  - Generate a Python/matplotlib graph to visually confirm
- Explain why the answer makes sense in context

## 5. Extend
- Suggest a related practice problem the student could try next
- Mention any generalizations or connections to other topics

If any step reveals a common mistake or misconception, flag it and explain how to avoid it.
