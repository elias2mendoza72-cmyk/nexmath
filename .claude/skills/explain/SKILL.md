Explain the calculus concept "$ARGUMENTS" using this structure:

1. **Intuition First**: Start with a real-world analogy or plain-English description. What is the core idea? Why does it matter? Make it concrete and relatable.

2. **Visual Representation**: Generate a Python matplotlib plot that illustrates the concept. For example:
   - For derivatives: plot a function and its tangent line at a point
   - For limits: show a function approaching a value
   - For integrals: shade the area under a curve
   Include clear code comments explaining each part of the visualization.

3. **Formal Definition**: State the precise mathematical definition using proper notation. Define all symbols.

4. **Worked Example**: Choose a specific, concrete example and walk through it step-by-step. Number each step and name the rule or property used.

5. **Common Mistakes**: List 2-3 errors students frequently make with this concept and explain why they're wrong.

6. **Connections & Applications**: Where does this concept appear in real life? How does it connect to other calculus topics?

Reference the relevant section in the provided textbooks (OpenStax Calculus Vol 1 and/or Stewart's Early Transcendentals 8th Ed) so the student can read further.
